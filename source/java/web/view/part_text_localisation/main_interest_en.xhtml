    <ul>
        <li>The average person in business reads no faster than people did 100 years ago.</li>
        <li>The average reading speed is 200 to 250 words a minute in non-technical material roughly 2 minutes per page. If you doubt this, test your reading speed - there is a reading speed test elsewhere in this site.</li>
        <li>In technical material, the average reading rate is approx 50 to 75 words a minute roughly 5 to 6 minutes per page.</li>
        <li>Total information is doubling every 9 months.</li>
        <li>Therefore we have to process information faster and faster just to maintain our existing knowledge level.</li>
        <li>500 000 new titles are published each year in the English language alone.</li>
        <li>However, the average American college graduate only reads 5 books in his/her post-college lifetime.</li>
        <li>We therefore end up knowing more and more about less, and less and less about just about everything else.</li>
